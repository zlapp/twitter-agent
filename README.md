# Twitter-Agent

This Python script is an example of an autonomous AI-powered agent for interacting with the Twitter API. The system uses OpenAI and LangChain to tweet, send direct messages, and reply to mentions. Unlike a traditional Twitter Bot, this agent is designed to dynamically interact with the environment by using a variety of tools (such as searching google and wikipedia).

Our goal with this project is to equal or surpass human level performance on Twitter.

## Capabilities

 The Twitter-Agent currently has the following capabilities: 

    Retweet: âœ… 
    Tweet: âœ… ðŸ¤–
    Reply to mentions: âœ… ðŸ¤–
    Reply to replies: âœ… ðŸ¤–
    Reply to direct messages: âœ… ðŸ¤–
    Like tweets: âœ… 
    Follow users: âœ… 

Next up: We plan to add longterm memory for all important actions as well as provide agent specific training based on the reception of each tweet and DM.  If you are interested in designing a good agent training plan let us know!

### Installation

1. Clone the repository via `git clone https://github.com/bigsky77/khafre.git` and `cd` into the cloned repository.
2. Start a Python virtual environment `python -m venv venv` and then `source activate venv/bin/activate` (optional but HIGHLY recommended).
3. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Copy the .env.example file to .env: `cp .env.example .env`. This is where you will set the ENV variables.
5. Set your OpenAI, and Twitter API keys in your new .env file.

### Execution

Some modules will not work unless you are signed up for a paid API key through Twitter.

1. First, run `python main.py` to authenticate your Twitter account using OAUTH2.
2. Once authenticated, run `python twitter_schedular.py` to start the AGI.
3. Write prompts.  `cp example_prompts.py prompts.py` and add prompts.

### Deployment

In order to deploy this agent, sign up for a [Render](https://render.com/) or another hosting site, and connect to your GitHub repository.
